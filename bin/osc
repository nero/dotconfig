# From ECMA-48:
# OSC is used as the opening delimiter of a control string for operating
# system use. The command string following may consist of a sequence of
# bit combinations in the range 00/08 to 00/13 and 02/00 to 07/14. The
# control string is closed by the terminating delimiter STRING TERMINATOR
# (ST). The interpretation of the command string depends on the relevant
# operating system.
